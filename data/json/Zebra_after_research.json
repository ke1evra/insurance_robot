I was first given a price, monthly, for the first payment -- and it was raised for evidently no reason. By the time the second came, it raised yet again 20 more dollars. Another 25 was added by my third time paying. They told me they would enable auto pay, despite my explanation to them via phone and email that I do not prefer auto pay. The payment continued to rise. While this IS terrible, they did profusely apologize and offer a -partial- refund, which I did end up accepting.",

I needed to have deer insurance because that is how I lost my last vehicle and everywhere else was so expensive but Bristol West was affordable. However, when my 6 months was done, I didn’t receive any communication to renew my insurance and my account was charged but I had already switched to another insurance and so far it’s taken months to get the money back and then I only get half back. I’m still sending in screenshots and scans of documents and they keep saying to resend what I already sent. So, fast forward 5 months later I’m still waiting to receive the rest of the money.",

They wouldn’t come out and take pictures of the wreck until several days later, then stated that they couldn’t be sure the car was damaged because of an accident. I suggest anyone with them to change insurance before they get into an accident. I’m sure they’re are different locations that are good, but if you check out other reviews there are more bad reviews of this company than good ones. I changed insurance companies and save over a hundred dollars every 6 months doing so.",

Has been very competitive & customer service has always been very helpful & friendly. My last car caught on fire while on a trip to neighboring state & the adjuster made the process easy to deal with (I was all shook up & had no idea what to do next. He helped me through it all & never made me feel like I was a bother)...& took care of everything in a very timely manner.",

They were faster to help me on the phone than my previous (nationally known) carrier - I had that previous plan through a broker. This I got through Costco. The coverage is identical but I am saving money each month.",
    "star_2": 5,
    "review_3": "I had this insurance company for 20+ years. They gained my trust when I first got them in my 20’s. Because within a couple of months of signing up with them I had my first car accident. I had heard horror stories about how companies would drop you or raise your premiums way up. They did not do either of those things which was amazing to me. I don’t know what I would/could of done if they had specially since I was young and broke. So until this day I truly recommend them, they are trustworthy and have great customer service. Also their rates are competitive with other insurance companies if you have a new car.",

We switched to them after buying a new vehicle and found our old insurance company was going to charge us double for our new car. I started to ask around to friends about their insurance company and a friend recommended MEEMIC to us. The rates for the same vehicle were half the price! We could not believe the difference between the two companies. We had moved to Michigan two years before this from Illinois, where car insurance is very different, they do not have no fault insurance like Michigan does. So we were very surprised at how expensive car insurance was in Michigan. \n\nHowever, with MEEMIC we have been able to bundle our car and homeowners insurance and receive a discount. We also have received discounts over the years for various other things on our homeowners insurance.",

An Amica representative called us to verify the details of the accident and about 10 days later called to let us know that they would be paying out $900 for damage.

First of all this claim has been going on for 3 months now and is still not resolved. I have contacted customer serivice with no response back. The customer service is the worst, plan on them not getting back to you untill they are ready to. The company just takes your money for your insurance payment and when you actually need them they are no where to be found. I have been interragated and put through so much unnessicary stress by their company. and when you ask them for an update you get no response back. The company has no respect for your personal life and do not treat their customers like human beings. Stay away from this insurance company to avoid future head aches, when you call to get a policy they are nothing but nice to you but when you actually need them plan on jumping through hoops for them. Go with a different company. This is not the one",

Can never find my policy when I call. Now to add insult to injury they require a hand written cancellation letter with each policy # and date you request termination MAILED to their headquarters...

It was a huge mess and obviously very inconvenient, especially happening right at the beginning of all the Covid-19 stuff! They hooked us up with a temporary sink and extra folding table, since we had to rip out our lower cabinets. Mike Shaw was our adjuster and very easy to work with! He responded to emails promptly and did a great job communicating everything to us and talking us through all of our options. \n\nThis week I received a renewal contract for this next year. Many of their reviews suggest they drop their clients after filing claims, but they did not drop us and we are so grateful to have more time with them as our insurance company!

Not only was Oregon Mutual AMAZING to deal with in the claim process, but my rates did not increase as a result of the accident. I cannot recommend them highly enough.",

    "review_1": "I was with another insurance company that decided to keep raising my premium every renewal period. Thus started looking for another insurance company. I had used this agency in the past and thought that would be a great starting place. For finding my new policy. This is when they suggested Ohio Mutual Ins Group. I questioned the company’s reputation. I was reassured by them telling me it was the same company I’d used before when I was with them. I got the quote and was taken aback. When they gave me the price of the quote. It was almost half the price of my then insurance company. Then I decided to ask about lowering my deductibles. I ended up lowering it. From $500 that my old policy had, that I’d be replacing to $100 on both collision and comprehensive. My old policy had the higher deductibles and run me $134 a month. My new policy with the new company was going to be $70 a month. I couldn’t pass it up. Cause I’d already had my trust in this company from having already at one time without complaint. So I bought the policy and paired it also with my renters policy. So with both. My monthly premium is a total of $79. I have no complaints so far and am happy with the web site this company has too! I recommend this company to anyone looking to save on their car insurance.",
    "star_1": 4,
    "review_2": "This was the cheapest policy that I found when I was shopping for insurance. We haven’t filed any claims, but I appreciate that the sent a letter recently that basically expanded what their insurance offers us at no extra cost.",
    "star_2": 5,
    "review_3": "We have been loyal customers for over 17 years. Our local agents were wonderful and very helpful. Our daughter was in a car accident, she was hit by a young man who ran a stop sign, no fault of her own. Ohio mutual was very unprofessional with us! Phone calls and emails went days unanswered. When we finally got an adjuster to call us back she was rude and offered us three thousand less than what our car was worth. Very unprofessional, we felt like we was a bother, you could tell she didn’t enjoy her job and she took it out on us. We ended up going through the other party’s insurance which was State Farm. They offered us a very fair amount of money to replace the totalled car. We have switched insurance over this. Do your homework before trusting Ohio mutual insurance!!!",

It was my first experience filing an insurance claim, and ever level was a nightmare. I currently no longer have Hastings Mutual as my insurance carrier, and I was not going to leave a bad review, because in the end my claim got paid, but going through my old emails I was just astounded at the ineptitude, rudeness, condescension, and complete lack of compassion I experience. I would full recommend that if you have Hastings Mutual you switch before you have to deal with the claims process. You might expect a higher level of service from a smaller company like this, but think again. No one will ever answer when you call, they appear to leave the office about 15 minutes early. The claims representatives, at least the 2 that I worked with are not helpful in the slightest (particularly one \" [REDACTED NAME] Messenger\"). It took 4 months for me to get the claim paid, due to poor communication. I asked to be switched to a different claims representative multiple times and was ignored. I could go on and on, but they made a horrible, stressful situation even worse. I had been a customer for 16 years, and I regret every penny I paid to them. When I contrasted my experience with the experience my mom had filing a claim last year with a larger insurance company I immediately switched.",

I, being the safe driver that i am, was credited with a safe driving discount. And, every so often they will lower my bill for not having any accidents or claims. This is the best Auto Insurance that i have ever had. Thanks Progressive!",

In the decade I’ve been in a total of 3 not-at-fault accidents, and not only did they take excellent and total care of me and my car from points A to B, my rates weren’t increased due to reckless driving of others. A+ customer service, and for my money, a company with integrity.",
